I used Gulp to create differently-sized images for a responsive design. I ahve two versions of gulpfile; one uses babel and ES6 syntax, and the other, which is located in the `backup` directory, doesn't. To run the gulpfile to generate the images (in `dist` directory), just type gulp in the terminal.

I used Boostrap for its grid layout. The logo was created using www.freelogodesign.org and converted to SVG format using Inkscape (hooray for open source!)
