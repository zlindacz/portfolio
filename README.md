## Linda's Portfolio

I used Gulp to create differently-sized images for a responsive design. Two versions of gulpfile: one with ES6 syntax in the other, located in the `backup` directory, doesn't use babel. I also used Boostrap for its grid layout.

The logo was created using www.freelogodesign.org and converted to SVG format using Inkscape (hooray for open source!)

Images are from Unsplash.com, specific attributions found in the `index.html` file.
